Hello there — I'm an undergraduate researcher at the [Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and a BSc (Honours) student in Data Science & AI at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/). I'm interested in building systems that can reason about the world and act intelligently in it.
{: .lead}

My research focuses on **reasoning** and **robotics**. I work on agent systems that combine learning and structured reasoning to solve complex tasks — whether that means a language model deciding which tools to use, or a robot learning to manipulate objects through interaction. Currently I'm involved with the **ToolBrain** project, exploring how agents can leverage external tools and APIs to extend their capabilities beyond what's encoded in model weights.

I care about building things that work reliably and can be reproduced. Outside of research I enjoy building some projects, playing chess and reading books.
