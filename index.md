Hello there — I'm an undergraduate researcher at the [Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and a BSc (Honours) student in Data Science & AI at University College Cork. I'm interested in building systems that can reason about the world and act intelligently in it.
{: .lead}

My research focuses on **world models** and **reasoning**. Currently I work on world models for continuous and multi-task reasoning, and I'm also contributing to the **ToolBrain** project.
